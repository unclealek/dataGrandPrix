- **Select driver/drivers**: Click to select driver or shift click to select multiple drivers


## Safety Car

The replay includes a **simulated Safety Car** that appears on track whenever the F1 data indicates a Safety Car deployment (track status code `4`). Since the F1 API does not provide GPS telemetry for the actual Safety Car, its position is simulated based on the race leader's position.

### How it works

- **Data source:** The Safety Car deployment timing comes from the real F1 track status data via FastF1 (`session.track_status`).
- **Position simulation:** The SC is placed ~500 meters ahead of the race leader on the track reference polyline. This approximates where the real SC would be relative to the field.
- **Three animation phases:**
  - **Deploying** — The SC animates from the pit lane onto the track over ~3 seconds, with a pulsing glow and "SC DEPLOYING" label.
  - **On Track** — The SC drives ahead of the leader with a steady amber glow and "SC" label.
  - **Returning** — The SC animates back to the pit lane over ~3 seconds, with a fading pulsing glow and "SC IN" label.
- **Visual appearance:** The SC is drawn as a larger orange/amber circle (8px radius vs 6px for regular cars) with an orange outline ring and always-visible "SC" label.

### Technical details

The SC position computation happens in `_compute_safety_car_positions()` in `src/f1_data.py`. Each frame gets a `safety_car` field:

```json
{
  "safety_car": {
    "x": 1234.56,
    "y": 7890.12,
    "phase": "on_track",
    "alpha": 1.0
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `x`, `y` | World coordinates of the SC |
| `phase` | `"deploying"`, `"on_track"`, or `"returning"` |
| `alpha` | Opacity value from `0.0` (invisible) to `1.0` (fully visible), used for fade in/out animation |

> **Note:** If you have existing cached `.pkl` files from previous runs, you must re-run with `--refresh-data` to generate SC position data. Older cached files will simply show no Safety Car.

## Qualifying Session Support (in development)

Recently added support for Qualifying session replays with telemetry visualization including speed, gear, throttle, and brake over the lap distance. This feature is still being refined.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- [FastF1](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1)
- [Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/)
- numpy

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

FastF1 cache folder will be created automatically on first run. If it is not created, you can manually create a folder named `.fastf1-cache` in the project root.

## Environment Setup

To get started with this project locally, you can follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IAmTomShaw/f1-race-replay
    cd f1-race-replay
    ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    This process differs based on your operating system.
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Application:**
    You can now run the application using the instructions in the Usage section below.

## Usage

**DEFAULT GUI MENU:** To use the new GUI menu system, you can simply run:
```bash
python main.py
```

![GUI Menu Preview](./resources/gui-menu.png)

This will open a graphical interface where you can select the year and round of the race weekend you want to replay. This is still a new feature, so please report any issues you encounter.

**OPTIONAL CLI MENU:** To use the CLI menu system, you can simply run:
```bash
python main.py --cli
```

![CLI Menu Preview](./resources/cli-menu.gif)

This will prompt you with series of questions and a list of options to make your choice from using the arrow keys and enter key.

If you would already know the year and round number of the session you would like to watch, you run the commands directly as follows:

Run the main script and specify the year and round:
```bash
python main.py --viewer --year 2025 --round 12
```

To run without HUD:
```bash
python main.py --viewer --year 2025 --round 12 --no-hud
```

To run a Sprint session (if the event has one), add `--sprint`:
```bash
python main.py --viewer --year 2025 --round 12 --sprint
```

The application will load a pre-computed telemetry dataset if you have run it before for the same event. To force re-computation of telemetry data, use the `--refresh-data` flag:
```bash
python main.py --viewer --year 2025 --round 12 --refresh-data
```

### Qualifying Session Replay

To run a Qualifying session replay, use the `--qualifying` flag:
```bash
python main.py --viewer --year 2025 --round 12 --qualifying
```

To run a Sprint Qualifying session (if the event has one), add `--sprint`:
```bash
python main.py --viewer --year 2025 --round 12 --qualifying --sprint
```

## Building Custom Telemetry Windows

When you start a race replay, an **Insights Menu** automatically appears, providing quick access to various telemetry analysis tools. You can easily create custom insight windows that receive live telemetry data using the `PitWallWindow` base class:

```python
from src.gui.pit_wall_window import PitWallWindow

class MyInsightWindow(PitWallWindow):
    def setup_ui(self):
        # Create your custom UI
        pass
    
    def on_telemetry_data(self, data):
        # Process telemetry data
        pass
```

The `PitWallWindow` base class handles all telemetry stream connection logic automatically, allowing you to focus solely on your window's functionality.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic connection to telemetry stream
- Built-in status bar with connection state
- Proper cleanup on window close
- Simple API - just implement `setup_ui()` and `on_telemetry_data()`

**Documentation & Examples:**
- See [docs/PitWallWindow.md](./docs/PitWallWindow.md) for complete guide
- See [docs/InsightsMenu.md](./docs/InsightsMenu.md) for adding insights to the menu
- Run the example: `python -m src.gui.example_pit_wall_window`
- Test the menu: `python -m src.gui.insights_menu`

## Customization

- Change track width, colors, and UI layout in `src/arcade_replay.py`.
- Adjust telemetry processing in `src/f1_data.py`.
- Create custom telemetry windows using `PitWallWindow` base class (see above).

# Known Issues

- The leaderboard appears to be inaccurate for the first few corners of the race. The leaderboard is also temporarily affected by a driver going in the pits. At the end of the race, the leaderboard is sometimes affected by the drivers' final x,y positions being further ahead than other drivers. These are known issues caused by inaccuracies in the telemetry and are being worked on for future releases. It's likely that these issues will be fixed in stages as improving the leaderboard accuracy is a complex task.
